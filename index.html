				<h4>Arts and Drawing</h4>
				<p>I love art because, for me, it conveys thoughts, ideas, and emotions that words cannot express. Through drawing, my mind clears up which helps me to relax.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i class="fa fa-cubes"></i>
				<h4>Playing Video Games</h4>
				<p>I like to play video games because I find it fun and entertaining. My favorite kind of games are open-world action RPGs such as Genshin Impact.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i class="fa fa-newspaper-o"></i>
				<h4>Traveling</h4>
				<p>I enjoy traveling because it forces me to step outside of my comfort zone and encourages me to see, taste, and try new things. It challenges me to adjust to new environments, engage with various people, embrace adventures, and share fresh and significant experiences with friends and family.</p>
